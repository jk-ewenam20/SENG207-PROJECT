### __Plot Diagram of pH__
![Plot Diagram of pH](./plot1.png)

- The graph above shows a graph of the dataset with pH as the grouping.
- From the graph, the highest pH count recorded is seen to be around 3.3 with a count above 50.

### __Scatter Plot of fixed acidity against pH__
![Scatter Plot of fixed acidity against pH](./plot3.png)

- This plot shows a scatter diagram of fixed acidity against the pH of the wine.
- The scatter plot is most concentrated between 6 and 12 on th fixed acidity axis and between 3.0 and 3.6 on the pH axis.
- The scatter plot has a negative correlation

### Bar Graph of pH values 
![Bar Graph of pH values](./plot4.png)

- The image above is a graph of the count of pH of the sames value in a bar graph format.
- Since the dataset is large, the graph only displays for the first 70 rows of the red wine data set.
